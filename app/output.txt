Hello everyone, Rick Richardson here with lecture 2.2 in Psych 1029. The topic for this lecture is Sperm Wars. To begin, I'm going to tell you a little bit about some species differences in testis size and type of sperm. Then, I'm going to describe some research showing how sperm can compete with one another. And I'll follow that up with some research showing exactly the opposite, that at least some of the time, in some species, sperm can cooperate. And then to finish the lecture, I'm going to describe very briefly how at least in some species, the female plays an active role in sperm wars. In terms of reproducing,  One might think that the male's job is done once he has copulated, that is, had sex, and ejaculated. And you might think that that's especially likely to be true in those many species where there's very little parental investment by the male. However, in many species, the act of copulation is just one step  toward winning the battle of passing on one's genes to the next generation. The popular image or popular notion of how each of us got here is that a single large ovum or egg was at some point in time surrounded by a wriggling mass of tiny sperm, each trying to fertilize the egg. and only one of which is successful. An implicit assumption of this notion is that all of the sperm surrounding the egg came from the same donor, from the same male. But for many species, that assumption is not correct. That is, in many species, the sperm of different males compete in their attempts to fertilize the egg. Now this competition has led to a number of amazing consequences, just some of which we'll consider in this lecture. For example, the degree of sperm competition, that is the likelihood that multiple males will mate with the female and that their sperm will compete at the same time to fertilize the egg of that female. has had a dramatic effect on testes size in the males. The testes are what produces the sperm, so that makes perfect sense. And you can see this relationship in this figure. So here, each dot represents a different species of fish that are ranked in terms of sperm competition. So those who are low ranked in sperm competition, means there's very little competition. That is, one male  generally will mate with a female. It's not multiple males mating with a female. Those that rank high, in contrast, multiple males are trying to mate with a female at the same time. So there's a lot of sperm competition. And if you look at that figure, you can see that as the amount of sperm competition, as the sperm competition rank increases, so does the relative testis size. So more competition leads to larger testes. Now here's a figure showing the relative size of testes to body size in various species of primates. I want you to note a couple of things in this figure. One is all of the measures are on a log scale. So, what looks like a little difference is actually a really big difference. The second thing I want you to note is that solid line that you can see going up towards the right at a 45 degree angle. Now that is where we would expect testicle size to fall if testis size is perfectly proportional to body size. That is, the bigger the body,  of one species relative to another species would be reflected by a comparable increase in the size of the testes. Dots above the line represent species where the testes are larger than one would expect given the animal's body size. And dots below the line indicate species where the testes are smaller than one would expect  given the animal's body size. Now I've labeled two dots here and I've colored them in. So one dot is for the chimpanzee and the other is for the gorilla, both closely related to humans. Now the dot for the chimpanzee, as you can see, is above the line. That indicates that the chimpanzee's testes are larger, and in this case quite a bit larger. Remember it's a log scale. their testes much, much larger than what we'd expect based on their body size. Now, why is that? Well, hopefully you'll recall from the weird sex lecture that in chimpanzees, it's not uncommon for females to mate multiple times with multiple males. So there's a fair bit, actually a lot of sperm competition in chimpanzees. But look at the gorilla. It's thought is well below the line. And the reason for that is there's not much sperm competition in gorillas. Gorillas practice a different mating strategy. And it's referred to as female defense polygyny. So in gorillas, the males fight. They use brute force to become the dominant male, the silverback. And so that male has preferential access  to mating with all the females in the group. Any sub-dominant males that tries to mate with a female, the dominant male, the silverback, will come and beat him down. So there's very little opportunity for those sub-dominant males to mate with females, which means there's little opportunity for sperm competition. Therefore, the gorillas have quite small testicles. relative to their body size. Well, what about humans? All the dots that are in that figure are gorillas, chimpanzees, other types of monkeys and apes, but what about humans? Where are we? Well, that's where we fall. That filled in, that black dot just below the line. Now, we're nowhere near the same unexpected  size difference as the gorilla, but we're clearly below the line, which indicates that throughout our evolution, there has been very low levels of sperm competition. There's been some, but nowhere near as much as a chimpanzee, and more than in a gorilla, but there has been relatively low levels of sperm competition in our species. Additional data suggesting mild or very low levels of sperm competition in our species can be seen in this table. Now there's lots of information in this table about testes size, sperm production, and other characteristics of sperm across a range of different species. But I want you to focus on the last two lines in this table. So there on the left,  The left column, you can see man. The average ejaculate volume in humans is about three and a half milliliters. And in that three and a half milliliters of fluid, there's about 350 million sperm. Now that fluid contains other things as well, but on average, when a human male ejaculates,  in his ejaculate there will be about 350 million sperm. That's quite a lot. But just take a look over at the ram. Now in rams there is considerable sperm competition. Rams have very, very large testicles, but you can see that the ejaculate volume is quite a bit less than what we see in humans. Now that might not be surprising given that they're much smaller than humans. But they're only producing on average 1.25 milliliters when they ejaculate. Less than half of what the human does. But look at the concentration of sperm in that ejaculate. So even though the ram is ejaculating less than half the fluid as a man, in that fluid, in that ejaculate, there's almost 10 times  the amount of sperm. Much more competition in rams, in rabbits, and other sorts of animals compared to humans. So here again we can see evidence that in our species there's been some but probably very low to mild levels of sperm competition throughout our evolutionary history. So what does this research  described so far shows us is that the amount of sperm competition affects a couple things in the male. The size of their testicles, the amount of sperm produced. But it's not just the testicle size and the amount of sperm that's produced that's been affected by competition, but it's also characteristics of the sperm itself. A study by Fitzpatrick and colleagues  Illustrates says, "And in this study, they looked at sperm in 29 closely related species of cichlid fishes, a type of fish, from a lake in Africa. Now these various species of fish differed in terms of the level of sperm competition. Some of the species were more monogamous, while others were more promiscuous, that is the female  would mate with multiple males. And what Fitzpatrick and colleagues found was that the sperm differed across the species as a function of level of competition. Not only did those species that faced more competition produce more sperm, but the sperm they produced were faster, bigger, and longer living. Now, all three of those characteristics are positively correlated with mating success. That is, faster, bigger, and longer-living sperm are more likely to make it to the egg and fertilize the egg, compared to sperm that are slower, smaller, and don't live as long. All right, so what I've described so far is evidence that sperm competition affects  sperm and testes. And the testes are the organ that makes the sperm. So that all seems fair enough. Not necessarily all that surprising. It's interesting, but not that surprising. But sperm competition affects a number of other factors or characteristics of animals. To illustrate just one example of this, I'm going to describe a study by Picnic. In this study, they compared the brain and the testes size in a number of different species of bats. Now across these species of bats, some of them were promiscuous, that is females mated with multiple males. And other species of bats were not promiscuous, they were more monogamous. And they simply grouped all of these species of bats into one of these two categories. "permissive" or "not permissive". And then they looked at the size of the testes and the size of the brains in these various categories of bats. Not surprisingly, in those bats where there was more female promiscuity, the males had larger testes. So that's just like what I've described for fish. So we see the same sort of thing here  in a mammal, in this case the bat, in those species where there's a lot of sperm competition, the males have larger testicles. Not a surprising thing. But what about the brains? Amazingly, there is also a difference between these two categories of bats in terms of their brain size. That is, the brains in those species  where there was a lot of female promiscuity, the average size of the brain was smaller in those bats than in bats where there was less promiscuity or more monogamy. Now that's pretty surprising I'd say, right? It's like, hold on, I can understand how sperm wars, sperm competition could affect the testicle size, could affect the sperm itself, but  How could it be affecting the brain of the animal? In particular, the male brain. What's going on there? How do we understand? How do we explain this? Well, one possibility is that brains and testes are both very expensive tissue. That is, both brains and testes require a lot of energy resources. So maybe  Those findings, reported by Picnick and colleagues, are due to the fact that both testes and brains are metabolically expensive, and a species has to trade off one against the other. In other words, investment in one, either the brain or the testes, constrains investment in the other. The animal can only obtain so much energy  and it makes a decision of where to invest that energy. Brain or testicles. If there's a lot of competition for reproducing, the suggestion is that they decide, not consciously of course, but evolution leads to animals that invest more of their resources in the testes than in the brain. If there's  not as much competition, well then they could use those resources to invest in this other metabolically expensive tissue, that is the brain, and thereby grow their brains. As one direct comparison to drive home this point about how the animals can differentially invest, let me just note that the bat with the largest testes, relatively speaking,  so relative to their body size, that particular species of bat invested more than twice as much energy in the testicles, in the testes, as in the brains. That is, in that particular species, the testes were 6.7% of their body mass, whereas the brain was only 3.2% of the body mass. Now something for you to ponder perhaps is does this occur within a species? That is, might it be the case that within a single species, let's say hypothetically humans, might it be the case that individuals with larger testicles have smaller brains or vice versa? Might this sort of process also be happening within a species or  might this process be restricted to, across species, where the time course for evolution is more likely to be revealed. Just something for you to ponder perhaps. In any case, let me make a final point about sperm competition. Now this competition doesn't just involve the sperm, that is having more, faster, longer living sperm. But there are other players in this game. That is, sperm competition can involve helping your own sperm and stopping the sperm of your competitors. Now, as I mentioned earlier, the ejaculate, or what's known as semen, contains more than sperm. That fluid contains a number of other secretions. In some social insects, like bees and ants, the semen also contains a substance that promotes survival of that particular male sperm and reduces the survival of any other male sperm. 




And this happens even if the other male is a brother, a close relative of that male. In other words, when  A male in one of these particular species of bees or ants ejaculates. There is this substance in its semen that helps its sperm survive, but if it encounters the sperm of any other male, it reduces the survival of that sperm. Critically, this is only seen in social insects where the females mate with multiple males, that is, in  insects where there's the possibility of sperm competition. In very, very similar social insects where females do not mate with multiple males, this is not observed. This extra substance in the semen is not found. So, here we can see lots of evidence that sperm competition occurs. It has a number of effects on the animal,  testicle size, brain size, and on the sperm. But it's not the case that sperm always compete. That is, at least in some species, sperm can't cooperate. After all, it's a jungle out there. The female reproductive tract is a dangerous, hostile place for sperm to be. After all, sperm  comes from a different organism, comes from the male. It is a foreign invader in terms of the female's body, and so her immune system can attack the sperm, can attack and kill it. So the sperm need to get out of the reproductive tract as quickly as possible in order to fertilize the egg. So, in some species, this has led to a form of  cooperation among the sperm. That is, in some species, sperm form what can be thought of as sperm trains. Now, here are two pictures of sperm in a petri dish. Now, this is sperm that comes from a type of mouse, in particular, a type of deer mouse. Now, when released, the sperm of this species are highly mobile single cells. But within one minute of being released, the sperm start grouping together, coming together in clumps. And it's not just random clumps, they actually hook into one another. And how do they do this? Well you can see in this picture that the head of the sperm in this particular species of deer mouse has a little hook. on the top of its head. And so it can hook into the head of other sperm. There's also little loops on the tail so they can hook into those loops on other sperm's tails. In any case, when the sperm group together, when they aggregate together like this, they can swim much faster than a single cell as they synchronize their tail movements. Now this has a couple  advantages. A group in a train and an aggregate, since it's swimming faster, first of all it's going to escape the hostile environment of the female reproductive tract much more quickly than a sperm trying to swim by itself. Also because they're synchronizing their movements they'll be faster and they're more likely to get to the egg sooner. Of course, only one of the sperm in such a tray could fertilize the egg, but it at least enhances their chances of getting there. Now, in a fascinating experiment, it was demonstrated that in some cases, there's what I'll call specificity in this cooperation. So, in this study,  They looked at two species of deer mice. P. manaculatus, this is a species where the females mate with multiple males, so there's a lot of opportunities for sperm competition. And the second species is P. polionotus. Now this is a monogamous species of deer mouse, so there's not much sperm competition. One male and one female tend  the pair bond, so there's not a lot of need for sperm competition or the opportunity for sperm competition in this species. They collected sperm from males of each species, and then what they were able to do in a Petri dish is they tagged the sperm with red or green fluorescent tags. That is, they attached a label onto the tail  of each sperm. So let's say that we have the sperm from two different males. One male, all of his sperm would be labeled red and the other one would be labeled green. And then when you look at the sperm underneath the microscope, you can tell which male each sperm came from. So in this experiment, as I said, they have sperm from these two different species of mice. Some of the sperm are labeled red,  some are labeled green, and then they mix them together in a petri dish and they looked at the aggregates that were formed. Now there are two conditions in this study. One is called the control condition. So in the control condition they take sperm from a single male and half of the sperm are labeled red and half are labeled green and then they put them together in the petri dish and they say okay when they aggregate together  Is it 50/50? Because after all, they're all from the same male. Or is there some other proportion? The control group is going to give us our baseline of comparison. Now what's called the treatment group. This involves sperm from two different males. And one of these males, all of his sperm is labeled red. And the other male's sperm are labeled  or tagged green. Then they mix them together. They look at the aggregates. Do the sperm from one male have a preference for forming a train, forming an aggregate or a group, a clump, a cluster with sperm from that same male? Or is it just random? Okay. Well, let me first show you the data from a single male. So this is a situation where  The sperm from one male has half of the sperm labeled red, half labeled gray. They're put together in a Petri dish and then the experimenters looked at the clumps, at the trays, to see whether half of them are red, half of them are green in the trays, or whether they preferentially went together. Now, you would expect this to be 50/50. It turned out it was close to 50/50. but it was a little bit higher, indicating that the process of tagging these cells led to a slight preference for some reason, don't know what it is, it's not important for us, but there's a slight preference for the red tailed sperm to aggregate with other red tailed sperm and the green tailed sperm to aggregate with the green tailed sperm, just slightly above chance. Now in the first comparison I'm going to show you,  What they did was they then looked at in the treatment condition sperm from two males from different species. So one male was from the Maniculata species and the other male was the Polionota species. Can these sperm tell, can they discriminate between sperm of their own species versus sperm of the other? So here we would have let's say all of the sperm from  the mannicholatus male, labeled red, and all the sperm from the polionotus male, labeled green. They put them in a petri dish, let them spend a few minutes aggregating, and then they just count how many of the same color are together. If the sperm can't discriminate, then they should be at the same level of aggregation as the control condition. That's not the case. Instead, we see a marked preference for sperm to aggregate together with sperm from the same species. And, as I've mentioned, the way that the experimenters were able to know it was from the same species is because they've labeled all of the sperm from the one male, the Maniculatus male, with a particular color, and all the sperm from the Polyanotus male with a different color. And it turns out about 75% of the sperm in any particular train are the same color. Much higher than what happens at baseline when it's from the same male. So it does appear from this that the sperm, these little tiny sperm, can discriminate between sperm of their own species and that of some other species. But,  While that's pretty impressive, what the experimenters did next was ask, "Well, how smart, if you will, are these sperm? How good are they at discriminating?" Yes, they can tell the difference between sperm of their own species versus the sperm of another species of deer mouse, but can they tell the difference between sperm from the same species? So, in the next comparison, what they did was they took sperm from two Maniculatus males. The sperm from one was labeled red, the sperm from the other was labeled green. But remember now, these are from the same species, just different males within that species. They mixed them together in the petri dish, waited for a little while, then counted the number of sperm of the same color together. And what you can see here, looking at the black bar, is once again, the sperm preferentially go with sperm that came from the same male. So, even though these are two males of the same species, the sperm can tell which male came from the same donor versus a different male. Now, that's pretty remarkable. when you consider that these are little tiny sperm with no brains or anything else, but yet they can still distinguish and they preferentially form trains with sperm from the same male. But that's what is observed in the Maniculatus, and as you recall, and as noted at the top of this slide, in that particular species of,  there's lots of sperm competition. Well, what about the Polionotus species? That is the species where there's not very much sperm competition. Do you see this same preferential sorting? That is, if you take the sperm from two males of this monogamous species of deer mouse, and you label one red and one green, you put them in a Petri dish together, allow them to aggregate,  look at the proportion of red and green in each trang. Do you see a preference just like was observed in the manacolotis? Turns out no you don't. It turns out there even when the two males are unrelated but they're both polionotus males the sperm don't discriminate. The polionotus sperm can discriminate between  Polyanota sperm and Maniculota sperm as shown in the heterospecific comparison, but when they are comparing sperm from the same species, they do not discriminate, do not distinguish between those very well. Now this makes some sense because after all, there's no history of competition in this particular species. The males and females are more monogamous. So these sperm, the sperm of this species of deer mouse, has not had to evolve the ability to make such a fine distinction. Well the final and last comparison examined in this particular study went back to the Maniculatus species. And as you can see in this figure,  The mannicholotis species can tell the difference between sperm from one donor of that species from sperm of another donor. Well what they tested in this last comparison is what if the other donor is also a mannicholotis male but is related to the other male. That is what if  You take the sperm of two brothers. You label one all red, the other all green. Put them together. Do you still see sperm trains primarily of green and primarily of red? Or, because of the close biological relatedness of the two donors, do they start not distinguishing as much? Well, it turns out that no, they still make the distinction. So, the sperm of one male preferentially form trains with sperm from that same male instead of forming trains with sperm from the male's brother. So, as I said, even though sperm are tiny with no brains, they can perform some simple discrimination. That is, they can distinguish sperm based on their source. Is it the same species as I am? Is it from the same male as I am? And if that sperm comes from a species where there's been a lot of sperm competition, they can even distinguish between closely related donors, that is brothers, sperm from brothers. So, disability to discriminate or distinguish between sperm  and the source of that sperm has been fine tuned in those mouse species where there is greater sperm competition. In this lecture I want to give you just one example of where females play a role in sperm competition. And to do this I'm going to describe a study by Pizarro and Birkhead that looked at the mating behavior in feral fowls. These are basically wild chickens  or jungle chickens, if you will. Now, in this species, most instances of copulation are coerced. That is, males essentially rape the female in the vast majority of cases of copulation. In jungle chickens and ferrofowls, there is a social hierarchy. So in the males, there are dominant males and sub-dominant males. But unlike in the gorilla, where only the dominant male has access, or has preferential access to the females, in wild chickens, all of the males have access. And so there's no differences in the number of copulations for dominant and sub-dominant males. It's also the case that there's no differences in the number of sperm in the ejaculate of dominant and sub-dominant males. So despite the fact that sub-dominant males have as much sperm in their ejaculate and that they have as much sex with females as dominant males, it turns out that dominant males are much more likely to impregnate the female. One can do DNA analysis to show that most of the offspring that result from copulation in this species  are due to the dominant male. But how is this possible? The female has no choice. She doesn't even get to acquiesce to having sex. Sex is forced upon her. And sub-dominant males have as much sex with a female as a dominant male. Well, there's one important factor that happens here.
